# Prompt Design Introduction

**Estimated time:** 20–30 minutes  
If you get stuck, ask the instructor. Have fun—this is hands-on.

## What you’ll learn
- A simple framework (**CRAFT**) for writing prompts that produce clearer, more useful results.  
- How to turn a weak, vague prompt into a strong one with structure and constraints.  
- How to evaluate responses for accuracy and fit to your goal.

## Before you start
Open **one** tool in your browser:
- [Perplexity](https://www.perplexity.ai/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} (often works without an account) **or** [Microsoft Copilot](https://copilot.microsoft.com/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} (UVic-licensed option available).  
You may use other tools if you prefer:
[ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"},
[Meta.ai](https://www.meta.ai/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"},
[Claude](https://claude.ai/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"},
[Google Gemini](https://gemini.google.com/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}.

> **Privacy note:** Don’t paste confidential or personal data. Redact names/emails/IDs (e.g., `[Researcher_A]`, `[Email_1]`). For data-handling details, see the UVic guidance linked on the Pre-Workshop page.

## Prompt Design Basics: The CRAFT Framework
Getting started is easy; getting **good** takes structure and practice. Use **CRAFT**:

- **Context** — Background and purpose. Who’s asking and why?  
  _Example:_ “I’m preparing a 60-minute lesson about weather for Grade 2.”

- **Role** — Who should the assistant act as?  
  _Example:_ “Act as an elementary school teacher.”

- **Action** — What exactly should be produced?  
  _Example:_ “Create a one-hour lesson plan plus a 30-minute activity.”

- **Format** — How should it be structured?  
  _Example:_ “Return bullet points with headings: Objectives, Materials, Steps, Assessment.”

- **Target Audience** — Who is this for? Adjust tone and level.  
  _Example:_ “Write at a Grade 2 reading level.”

> **CRAFT+ (recommended):** Add **Constraints** (time, word count, must include/avoid), and **Evidence** (citations/URLs) when facts matter.
