# GenAI Introduction & Prompt Design: A Double-Edged Sword
### UVic Libraries Digital Scholarship Commmons

# GenAI Workshop (Repo Guide)

## Structure
- `index.md` (about)
- `pre-workshop.md` (setup)
- `1-7` activity pages (core)
- `workshop-activities*.md` (track hubs)
- `additional-resources.md`, `informal-credentials.md`, `workshop-survey.md`

## Edit conventions
- Plain English, short sentences
- Sections: What you’ll learn • Do this now • Reflection • Self-check
- External links: add `rel="noopener"`
- Images: alt text describes purpose, not file name

## Local preview
```bash
bundle install
bundle exec jekyll serve


**Commit:** `README: structure, edit conventions, local preview`

---

# Optional (only if you want)
If you want a **printable one-page checklist**, add a *new* page `checklist.md` (nav_order after 9) with the five “Badge evidence” items. Otherwise, skip it to avoid extra pages.

---

## TL;DR
- **No new pages needed** for 7–17. We **extend** the existing ones with these blocks.  
- Use the commit messages I listed to keep the history human and tidy.  
- If you want a printable checklist, that’s the only new file I’d add.

If you paste these blocks in now, I’ll do a pass on any remaining pages you want polished (or generate the printable checklist).
