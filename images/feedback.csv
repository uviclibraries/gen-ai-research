After the workshop, I understand how the digital dashboard works. Thank you for offering this workshop.
Animation speed in the workshop activities is too fast to easily grasp without opportunity to reduce speed to learner's pace
Appreciated the bonus and extra resource materials provided. Thank you.
Dani was very clear, organized and personable - altogether a most effective teacher
Dani was very kind, engaging, knowledgeable, and helpful!
Don't have the program on my computer since admin needs to set up so got nothing out of course. didn't realize was all on my own on trying to set this up.
Excellent and exactly what I was looking for. A good example of how to run an online course. Thanks.
Excellent work in terms of the course designing. Thank you!
Great class and great instruction- Thanks Rich!
Great instructor, interested in our work, very helpful. Happy to have access to this service here at UVic!
Great Job! It was pretty straightforward especially given the walk-through at the beginning.
Great job. Fairly casual and yet very thorough. Thanks Rich.
Great! It was time well spent... which I can't say for every time I get on Zoom!
Having files ready to work on is very helpful rather than spending more time inputting data. It would be nice to join another EXCEL data analysis workshop that covers more on large sets of data like for example, creating a chart or looking up values using different files.
Hey! Didn’t actually attend the course because after waiting in the zoom call for over 10 minutes past the start time there was no sign of any other participants - not sure if given an incorrect zoom link or if there were issues with connecting for instructor! 
I appreciate this and the other many workshops you offer. 
I appreciated the reminders that everyone is working at their own pace. I would have preferred an introduction that addressed simple questions for beginners - while more advanced students could continue on with the workbook. I spent some time waiting for my turn to ask yet another simple question.
I arrived late after the intro and demo, and my experience was great. I would be better equipped had I came on time. Rich was very helpful and we were encouraged to reach out if we need additional support.
I attended the workshop in person. The workshop and main facilitator were great, as well as the two facilitators on site (many thanks to them, as they were super helpful), but the hybrid format personally did not really work for me - I feel those workshops should be either online, or in-person. Attending in person when the workshop is happening online means that there are talks around you in the room about one thing, while the facilitator, who (of course) is not aware of it, keeps talking about something different. So I found it a bit hard to concentrate in that environment, and I think I would rather have done it entirely online. But that's really just about the format of the workshop - the content and facilitators were great. Thank you!
I don't think we ever got around to talking about publishing podcasts. I would like to learn more. If there's a level 2 workshop, I would be interested in taking it. 
I enjoyed this session, and I learned a lot from the instructor. Thank you! 
I find when the instructors in your courses talk, that it interrupts my concentration when I am learning. Once the self-paced activity begins, could they put they speak once and tell us that they will put comments in the chat instead?
I found this course to be so informative. I learned a lot in a short amount of time, and will be using the tools I learned in my current role. I enjoyed the format very much, and the instructor was great. She was available to assist if we had any questions, or ran in to issues along the way.
I found this workshop extremely frustrating. It did not suit my learning style at all. I would prefer in person or one on one instruction if available.
I had already trialled NVivo so I could not download NVivo 12. Otherwise, many thanks for offering this workshop online. Online is my only option at present
I have never felt more welcome at a Zoom workshop than how I felt at this event. Their efforts to greet and chat with me really helped to reduce how intimidated I felt since I didn't have any experience with the topic. I was also so impressed with how generous the hosts were with their time and expertise. I was attending remotely and they took the time to answer my questions in detail. Thank you so much to your staff! 
I have problems with the UVic license, I couldn't finish the activity at time, however when the help desk send me the correct link to download the NVivo I could finish it. The intro was helpful and the instructor was really good.
I liked that when you shared the screen it was only visible to the instructors and not the whole class
I really appreciate this hybrid workshop
I thought it was a great use of my time. Thank you.
I thought it was well done. The instructors were very accommodating and knowledgeable.
i would be interested in learning more about Tableau
I would love to do another canva class!
I'm grateful. My wife, also a student, told me about this. I'd love to know how to find offerings myself.
I've really appreciated everything I've learned. thanks so much!
It is a good method of classroom teaching.
It is nice to know that there is additional help when needed after the workshop. Thank you.
It was a fantastic class which I would love to come again and have more such experiences. 
It was a great workshop and I learned so much. Thank you!!!
t was very well organized, and a great pace. So awesome that he was there to help us out. Very well done!
It's very frustrating to listen to others work through problems and not see what's going on. If you want seperation using breakout rooms so others don't have to hear what they can't see would be wonderful!
Just a big thanks you to Jessica. She has been super helpful.
Look forward to taking more courses. 
Make the process slightly easier!
Maybe have the instructor show a fully developed project to participants at the end? That way there is a visual of how far you can take it. 
More of a warm welcome and intro at the start, a bit more human interaction for newbies and the shy/introverted
Nope! I thought it was great! Thanks very much. I feel much more confident about using the tool now. 
Nope! Thanks, Matt! You mentioned that there would be an ""advanced"" workshop in the future. I don't see it listed yet, but would love to learn more! :)
Only to say thank you, this was great and I'm looking forward to the next NVIVO workshop."
Really well done! Instructors were knowledgable and enthusiastic to help me and answer all of my questions
Rich and Dani were very helpful and worked together extremely well to ensure everyone's questions and concerns were addressed throughout the workshop. Thank you very much.
Rich did a great job. I look forward to when we can do these courses in person.
Super appreciated for the Helping to Free Learn and education. 
Thank you so much! I thought the material and the instructors were very friendly and helpful. Had this workshop been in-person (less audial distractions), and if there were additional follow-up sessions, I think I would feel more confident using the software. But otherwise, it was a great introduction and it solidified that NVivo really is the right software for my project.
Thank you very much for all of your help and in instructing this workshop! I really appreciate that these types of workshops are offered!
Thank you very much for all of your help! I really enjoyed the format and the workshop! 
Thank you very much for preparing this useful material, Rich!
Thank you! Appreciate the time that you took to answer questions, and the offer to meet for further help.  Makes the library a better place to be!"
Thank you! Appreciated the instructor's patience and flexibility to use the time in a way that supported student needs, rather than stick to a rigid powerpoint presentation. 
Thank you! Sharon was great. I really appreciate them providing us their email so we can follow up with any questions or go check out their office hours. Thanks again. 
Thanks again for the excellent workshop today, Rich
thanks for the good resources and have a nice day :)
Thanks for the great workshop.
That was a lot of fun and very informative, thanks Rich and Brittany!
That’s a pretty good course
The experience was excellent. HTML and CSS become easier now.
"The instructor gave clear explanations, the class was dynamic and he was very patient with my many questions. Thank you very much.
The instructor was very responsive and helpful in answering questions.
The question about the length of the workshop. I would prefer if the same length but an opportunity to have another session to go over the exercises and also see alternate ways of doing the exercises.
The workshop is great with an introduction and an ice breaker activity. However, I think it would be more beneficial for attendees if some elements could have changed. First, it would have been designed with very clear objectives and interactive activities which align with the objectives. For example, tips for the design, purposes of the design, how to add pictures and videos, how to launch it, etc. It lacked these steps, so attendees felt confused. Second, it would have been better if some cavas presentations and posters had been introduced and analyzed in the first part "" the introduction"". This would help the participants have a sense of the design and how the authors designed it that way. This would also help participants have an overview of how to design and layout with canvas. Third, it would have been helpful if the instructor had given a topic for design and steps to design it.
"The workshop participant introductions seemed unnecessary - could have been done with a chat blast. The first half hour of content was unnecessary as it was covered in the video we were asked to watch prior to the workshop.  I ended up leaving the workshop after scanning the lab exercise part - I didn't think it was very useful to learn the tools on someone else's data set and I thought that the instructions were not clear enough. If I had to figure it out on my own, why do I need the workshop?"
The workshop was good and I hope you keep it for next students.
The workshop was great. I'm amused that this survey is through google docs, which was specifically called out during the SurveyMonkey workshop because the data is not stored in Canada :)"
There was a lot if “lingo” that I did not know. So maybe some more basic language for those of us who are new to programming/coding but need to know, understand, and use it as it is required for our degree. "
This class was great. Looking forward to other ones. Thank you.
This was wonderful! Every experience I have with the Digital Scholarship Commons has been inspiring and helpful, especially for someone who isn’t tech savvy. Keep doing what you’re doing! Have a good day!"
UVic is lucky to have Rich!  He is an amazing instructor - communication and instruction skills are impressive.  And he is incredibly intelligent and broad in his skill set.
Wonderful course. Really helped me to finally use macros successfully and learn about dashboards
Would appreciate a copy.of the video recording as I wasn't able to access
Would love to see an advanced GIS course, both for ArcGIS and QGIS!
Would love to see more excel based classes especially further macro and pivot tables
