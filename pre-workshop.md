## Pre-Workshop: 25-minute prep
Pre-workshop: add 25-min prep plan, fix links/embeds, safety rules, and readiness checks

This workshop is mostly hands-on. Do these light prep steps so you can jump straight into practice.

### What to bring (2 min)
- A short paragraph or summary you’re comfortable using for exercises.
- Access to **one** general-purpose GenAI tool (any one is fine).
- Headphones (optional, for video/transcription demos).

### Choose your tool (3–5 min)
Pick **one** you can sign into easily:
- [Perplexity](https://www.perplexity.ai/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} (general purpose)
- [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} (general purpose)
- [Meta.ai](https://meta.ai){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} (general purpose, strong free images)
- [Google Gemini](https://gemini.google.com/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} (general purpose)
- [Claude](https://claude.ai/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} (general purpose)
- [Microsoft Copilot (UVic licensed)](https://copilot.microsoft.com){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} (general purpose)

> Tip: If sign-in is blocked on your device, use a different one from the list or your UVic-licensed option.

### Quick readiness checks (5–6 min)
- You can **log into one tool** and open a new chat.  
- You have a **practice paragraph** ready to paste.  
- You can state your **goal** in one sentence (e.g., “Summarize for a first-year reader”).  
- You know how to **copy a link** or reference a source you used.  
- You can explain **one integrity rule** you must follow in your course.

### Data safety rules (2 min)
- **Do not paste** confidential, personal, or proprietary information.  
- **Redact** names/emails/IDs using role placeholders (e.g., `[Researcher_A]`, `[Email_1]`).  
- **Cite** sources for specific facts or quotations.  
- **Verify** before you submit—your name is on the final work.
