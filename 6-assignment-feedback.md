# Assignment Feedback
<img src="images/6-genai-feedback-2.png" style="float:right;width:300px;" alt="A computer helping a child with their assignment">
Let's start work on a practical exercise that will demonstrate how GenAI tools can become your personal assignment pre-submission feedback partner. In this hands-on activity, you'll explore how to effectively provide a GenAI tool with assignment instructions along with your completed assignment to give you custom feedback. We'll then explore specific prompts you can use to gain valuable insights into whether you've fully addressed all aspects of the assignment and to receive targeted suggestions for enhancing the clarity and quality of your writing. 

The use GenAI tools for self-assessment is encouraged by UVic's department of Learning and Teaching Support and Innovation (LTSI). Here is a quote from LTSI on their Teach Anywhere website: "The use of GAITs for self-assessment is encouraged" ([LTSI, 2024](https://teachanywhere.uvic.ca/top-post/genai-position-statement/){:target="_blank"}. 

> **NOTE: If one of your professors does not allow the use of GenAI for any aspect of an assignment, then the only use permitted by UVic in that case is to use GenAI for assignment feedback after you've completed a draft of the assignment and -NOT- for use in any other way to assist in completing the assignment.
> Note 2: Some professors may allow a limited use of GenAI in Assignment completing, in which case you could also use GenAI for assignment feedback.**

If you have any questions or get stuck as you work through this in-class GenAI exercise, please ask the instructor for assistance.  Have fun!

## A Text Only Assignment Example
### Let's Get Started
1. If you haven't already, in your favourite web browser please open either [**Perplexity.ai**](https://www.perplexity.ai/){:target="_blank"} (no account required) -OR- [**Microsoft Copilot**](https://copilot.microsoft.com/){:target="_blank"}.
3. We need two things in order to request feedback on an assignment you're ready to submit. You can use your own completed assignment and assignment instructions from your instructor **-OR-** you can use the following sample completed assignment and assignment instructions:
   - **Assignment instructions**:
      - Include a concise summary of the technologies, teaching methods, or topics from this week's class that you are reflecting on or commenting on;
      - Your post demonstrates a critical reflection on the technologies, or teaching methods, including (but not limited to): possible benefits & drawbacks, age appropriateness, possible or actual privacy & security issues, and possible equity issues;
      - Utilize social writing strategies such as hyperlinks to blog posts (e.g., trackbacks) or to articles/resources consulted, including web pages, images, videos, etc.
   - **Sample completed assignment text**: "Coming back from spring break, I felt ready to dive back into the semester and finish strong as I work toward completing my degree. This week, our class focused on annotation and curation, especially using digital tools like Zotero and Hypothes.is. Hypothes.is, in particular, acts as a group annotation plugin, encouraging more social engagement and personal input from peers. This is a contrast to the typical web model that relies on anonymity and aggregated information. The feature that allows users to rank and comment on content adds a new layer of perspective—rather than being guided by an algorithm’s hidden logic, the experience feels more collaborative and transparent, almost like a form of crowd-sourced insight. Zotero, on the other hand, is a helpful resource for organizing and storing sources. It’s especially useful for managing references during large writing projects like essays or research papers. While I personally may not continue using it—since I’ve been comfortable with citation generators and managing my sources manually—it was still valuable to explore. Overall, both tools gave me a better sense of what’s out there in terms of browser extensions that support academic work."
     
### What Kind Of Feedback Do You Want?
Next we'll bring together the **prompt**, the **assignment instructions**, and the **completed assignment**.
5. First, let's determine the Type of Feedback You Need. Be specific about what kind of feedback you are looking for. For example, you could ask for feedback on:
   - How well it addresses the assignment instructions
   - Clarity and coherence
   - Accuracy of information
   - Areas for improvement
6. The first part of the prompt... : 
6. Let's assume for the sample assignment that we are looking for help with the following:
5. Copy and paste the following prompt into Perplexity or Microsoft Copilot: ```I'd like feedback on an assignment I've completed, including feedback on completion. Here are the assignment instructions: Include a concise summary of the technologies, teaching methods, or topics from this week's class that you are reflecting on or commenting on; Employ a multimedia strategy for your post by using text and one or more other media to enrich your post and help make it more engaging (e.g., screencast, podcast, video, sketchnote, image, infographics, or other formats); Your post demonstrates a critical reflection on the technologies, or teaching methods, including (but not limited to): possible benefits & drawbacks, age appropriateness, possible or actual privacy & security issues, and possible equity issues; Utilize social writing strategies such as hyperlinks to blog posts (e.g., trackbacks) or to articles/resources consulted, including web pages, images, videos, etc.```

```Returning from spring break I felt prepared to continue through the semester and finish my degree on a high note. This week our class touched on annotation and curation, specifically working with some digital tools that aid with annotations like zotero and hypothes.is. The latter functions as a group annotation plug-in, allowing more social interaction and personal feedback and information from others rather than the popular model of anonymity and compilation/conglomeration of sources on the regular web. The ability to rank information gives a different perspective on what’s being presented to you. Rather than an algorithm carefully picking which information to feed you, it feels more crowdsourced and objective instead of a viewpoint being forced upon you. Zotero is a tool that helps organize and save sources being used in most capacities. The ability to keep track of sources being used when writing a lengthy essay or research paper can be very helpful. Overall it’s not one I will likely use going forward as I haven’t had any issues with citation generators and tracking sources myself. Overall they were both helpful to learn and broaden my understanding of what is available in terms of browser extensions. ```
6. Attach the completed assignment (the sample assignment is the PDF file you downloaded in Step 3).
7. Submit Your Request. Send your message containing the assignment instructions, your work, and your specific feedback requests to Gemini.
8. Review Gemini's Feedback. Gemini will process your input and provide feedback based on your request. Read the feedback carefully.

### Follow-up Questions or Prompts
8. Ask Follow-Up Questions (Optional). If you need clarification or have further questions about the feedback, don't hesitate to ask Gemini for more details or examples. You can engage in a dialogue to deepen your understanding.
9. Revise Your Work. Use the feedback you received from Gemini to revise and improve your assignment before submitting it. Example of how you might structure your conversation with Gemini:
- You: ```I'd like some feedback on an assignment I've completed. Here are the instructions: [Paste assignment instructions here]```
- You: ```Okay, here is my work: [Paste your assignment content here]```
- You: ```Could you please provide feedback on how well my work addresses all parts of the assignment, the clarity of my arguments, and any areas where I could improve the structure and organization? Thank you.```
