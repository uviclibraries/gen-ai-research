# Assignment Feedback or Formative Assessment
<img src="images/6-genai-feedback-2.png" style="float:right;width:320px;" alt="A computer helping a child with their assignment">
Let's start work on a practical exercise that will demonstrate the power of Generative AI as your personal assignment pre-submission feedback partner. In this hands-on activity, you'll experience firsthand how to effectively provide a GenAI tool with assignment instructions and your completed assignment. We'll then explore specific prompts you can use to gain valuable insights into whether you've fully addressed all aspects of the assignment and to receive targeted suggestions for enhancing the clarity and quality of your writing. 

If you have any questions or get stuck as you work through this in-class GenAI exercise, please ask the instructor for assistance.  Have fun!

## Getting started
1. Access Gemini. Open the Gemini interface. This might be through a website (like gemini.google.com) or an application, depending on how you are accessing it.
2. Start a New Chat. Initiate a new conversation or chat session with Gemini.
3. Provide Context - The Assignment Instructions. Clearly state that you would like feedback on an assignment.Copy and paste the exact instructions for the assignment into the chat. This is crucial for Gemini to understand the requirements and expectations of your work.
4. Provide Your Work. Once you've provided the instructions, clearly indicate that you will now share your work.
Copy and paste the content of your assignment directly into the chat. Ensure all relevant parts of your work are included.

## Specify the feedback you would like
5. Specify the Type of Feedback You Need. Be specific about what kind of feedback you are looking for. For example, you could ask for feedback on:
- Clarity and coherence
- Accuracy of information
- How well it addresses the assignment prompt
- Grammar and spelling
- Structure and organization
- Strength of arguments (if applicable)
- Areas for improvement
- Specific sections or aspects of your work
6. Submit Your Request. Send your message containing the assignment instructions, your work, and your specific feedback requests to Gemini.
7. Review Gemini's Feedback. Gemini will process your input and provide feedback based on your request. Read the feedback carefully.

Step 8: Ask Follow-Up Questions (Optional). If you need clarification or have further questions about the feedback, don't hesitate to ask Gemini for more details or examples. You can engage in a dialogue to deepen your understanding.

Step 9: Revise Your Work. Use the feedback you received from Gemini to revise and improve your assignment before submitting it.

Example of how you might structure your conversation with Gemini:

You: "Hi Gemini, I'd like some feedback on an assignment I've completed. Here are the instructions: [Paste assignment instructions here]"

You: "Okay, here is my work: [Paste your assignment content here]"

You: "Could you please provide feedback on how well my work addresses all parts of the assignment, the clarity of my arguments, and any areas where I could improve the structure and organization? Thank you."

By following these steps, you can effectively use Gemini to get valuable feedback on your assignments. Remember to be clear and specific in your requests to get the most helpful responses.
