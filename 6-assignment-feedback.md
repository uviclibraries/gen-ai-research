# Assignment Feedback (Pre-Submit Check)
<img src="images/6-genai-feedback-2.png" style="float:right;width:300px;padding:6px;" alt="Student reviewing structured feedback before submitting an assignment">

Use GenAI to get **specific, auditable feedback**—then turn it into a short **fix plan** you can actually execute before you submit.

> **Integrity reminder:** Follow your course rules about GenAI. Redact names/emails/IDs (e.g., `[Person_A]`, `[Email_1]`). You are responsible for the final work; verify all facts and sources. UVic’s LTSI notes that **self-assessment with GenAI** is encouraged when permitted by your instructor ([LTSI, 2024](https://teachanywhere.uvic.ca/top-post/genai-position-statement/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}).

## Before you start
- Have your draft (or a 1–2 paragraph sample) ready.
- Keep the **assignment instructions** handy.
- Redact PII in your draft (e.g., `[Person_A]`, `[Email_1]`).

## Guided examples (keep these screenshots)

### A. Text-only assignment
Use **Perplexity** or **Microsoft Copilot**:
1. Gather your **assignment instructions** and your **completed draft** (or use the sample below).  
2. Ask for rubric scoring and a Top-5 Fix Plan (see prompts above).  
3. Review feedback for errors/omissions before making changes.

**Assignment instructions (example):**
- Include a concise summary of the technologies, teaching methods, or topics from this week’s class.  
- Demonstrate critical reflection (benefits/drawbacks, age appropriateness, privacy/security, equity).  
- Use social writing strategies (hyperlinks to posts/resources consulted).

**Sample completed assignment text (example):**  
“Coming back from spring break, I felt ready to dive back into the semester and finish strong… [keep your original example text here]”

**Reflect**
- Did it suggest missing items from the instructions?  
- Any mistakes or weak advice?  
- Which two fixes will you implement first?

### B. Mixed-media assignment (PDF upload)
1. Open **Perplexity** or **Copilot**.  
2. Download the sample PDF: [sample completed assignment](images/6-assignment-1.pdf){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}.  
3. Paste the **assignment instructions** (below), then **attach the PDF**, then request the rubric scoring and Top-5 Fix Plan.

**Assignment instructions (example):**
- Concise summary of this week’s technologies or methods.  
- Use text **and** at least one other medium (screencast, podcast, video, sketchnote, image, infographic).  
- Critical reflection (benefits/drawbacks, age appropriateness, privacy/security, equity).  
- Social writing strategies (hyperlinks to consulted resources).

**Reflect**
- Did the rubric surface missing media elements or weak evidence?  
- Are suggested changes concrete (location + action + why)?  
- What will you update now?

---

## Self-check (2 min)
- Do I have a **rubric table** with scores and evidence quotes?  
- Do I have a **Top-5 Fix Plan** with locations and actions?  
- Did I verify **facts** and add/format **citations**?  
- Does my draft now match **length** and **format** requirements?  
- If GenAI was used, did I include a **short attribution** if required?
