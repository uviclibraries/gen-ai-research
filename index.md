# GenAI Introduction & Prompt Design: A Double-Edged Sword

**Time plan:** Pre-work 25 min • Mini-lecture 15 min • Hands-on 65 min

GenAI can accelerate good work—or amplify weak work. This workshop gives you simple prompts, safety rules, and practice so you can use GenAI productively without undermining judgment or academic integrity.

You’ll start with **prompt design** and the **ethics/safety** basics that matter in student research. In the hands-on segment, you’ll evaluate GenAI outputs for **accuracy** and **bias**, and you’ll see how UVic policies shape responsible use.

## What you’ll learn (learning objectives)

By the end of this **introductory** workshop, you will be able to:

1. **Explain GenAI** and list where it helps in academic work.  
2. **Write better prompts** using audience, format, constraints, and evidence requests.  
3. **Run a basic fact-check loop** (ask for claims → verify with two sources → correct errors).  
4. **Adjust privacy settings** and read T&Cs with a safety mindset.  
5. **Use GenAI for practical tasks** (brainstorming, outlining, formatting) without breaching integrity.  
6. **Give pre-submit feedback** on your own assignments using a simple rubric.  
7. **Evaluate output quality** for accuracy, relevance, bias, and missing context.  
8. **Follow UVic expectations** for academic integrity and responsible use.

## Prompt vs Prompt Design

**A prompt** = the instructions you give the model.  
Think: “Do X, in this format, for this audience, using this data, under these constraints.”

**Prompt Design** = the iterative process of turning a vague goal into a prompt that consistently produces usable output.

---

## The Prompt Design Loop 

1) **Idea / Goal** (what outcome do you actually need?)  
2) **Prompt** (instructions + context + constraints)  
3) **Result** (model output)  
4) **Test** (is it correct, usable, safe, complete?)  
5) **Feedback + Refine** (tighten constraints, add examples, fix format)  

---

## “Art” and “Science” (yes, both)

- **Art**: creativity in framing, examples, roles, and constraints.
- **Science**: models respond predictably to structure, clarity, scope, and evaluation.
