# Generative AI for Student Research

- Pre-workshop activities: 25 min 
- Introductory presentation: 15 min
- Active learning time: 65 min

## About the Workshop 

Workshop participants will explore the use of Generative AI (GenAI) to assist with Student Research for idea generation, and literature reviews, and consider ethical considerations such as plagiarism, privacy, and research integrity. Participants will gain a basic understanding of GenAI and the ethical implications of its use in student research. In the hands-on portion of the workshop, participants will explore GenAI tool usage and output evaluation for accuracy and biases. The workshop will also cover UVic policies, attribution methods, library resource integration, and campus support services, to encourage informed, responsible GenAI use.

## Learning objectives
### Introductory Generative AI for Student Research
At the end of this **Introductory** portion of this workshop, you will be able to:

1. Understand Generative AI: Define Generative AI and explain its relevance and potential applications in student research.
2. Ethical Considerations: Discuss the ethical implications of using GenAI in academic work, including issues related to plagiarism, data privacy, and research integrity.
3. Apply strategies such as prompt design, critical review of terms and conditions, and adjustments to privacy settings to address GenAI ethics and safety issues.
5. Explore Use Cases: Identify specific use cases of different GenAI in academic settings, such as literature review, idea generation, and data analysis.
6. Practical Applications: Demonstrate how to use Generative AI tools effectively for research purposes, including tips for generating useful outputs and refining queries.
7. Evaluate Quality and Reliability: Teach participants how to critically evaluate the outputs of Generative AI tools, including assessing accuracy, relevance, and potential biases.
8. Attribution: Cite outputs from GenAI tools using APA, MLA, IEEE, or other citation styles.
9. UVic Policies: Describe UVic policies and guidelines that relate to the use of GenAI, and understand their implications for academic integrity.
10. Stay Informed: Be familiar with other places on campus, like LTSI, which can support you in the effective and appropriate use of GenAI.

### Intermediate Generative AI for Student Research
At the end of this **Intermediate** portion of this workshop, you will be able to:

1. Install GenAI software on your laptop including 1 or more large language models (not cloud-based), and use it to answer a question.
5. Use the local GenAI software and select a folder of documents on your computer to use as training data; then ask questions of the documents.
6. **COMING Spring 2025:** Use advanced literature review tools for graduate-level research.
7. **COMING Spring 2025:** Integrate citation managers into your search strategy using tools like Zotero & Research Rabbit.
8. Transcribe interviews using cloud-based AI transcription services and an AI-powered program that runs locally on your computer.
9. Use GenAI tools to conduct Sentiment Analysis on free-form survey questions or social media posts.

**NOTE**: _You can earn DSC Badges by completing the Introductory and/or the Intermediate portions of this workshop._
